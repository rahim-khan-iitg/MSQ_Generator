    "text=\"\"\" Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into\n",
    " chemical energy that, through cellular respiration, can later be released to fuel the organism's\n",
    " activities. Some of this chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars and\n",
    " starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water– hence the name photosynthesis,\n",
    " from the Greek phōs, \"light\", and synthesis , \"putting together\". Most plants, algae, and\n",
    " cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis\n",
    " is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere,\n",
    " and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.\n",
    " Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins\n",
    " when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centers that contain green chlorophyll\n",
    " (and other colored) pigments/chromophores. In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles\n",
    " called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in\n",
    " the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons\n",
    " from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting\n",
    " of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy,\n",
    " enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced nicotinamide adenine\n",
    " dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells.\n",
    " In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of\n",
    " light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide\n",
    " is incorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate\n",
    " (RuBP).[5] Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting\n",
    " compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose. In other\n",
    " bacteria, different mechanisms such as the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end.\n",
    " The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most\n",
    " likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, rather than water, as sources of\n",
    " electrons. Cyanobacteria appeared later; the excess oxygen they produced contributed directly to\n",
    " the oxygenation of the Earth, which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. Today, the\n",
    " average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130 terawatts, which is\n",
    " about eight times the current power consumption of human civilization. Photosynthetic organisms\n",
    " also convert around 100–115 billion tons (91–104 Pg petagrams, or billion metric tons), of carbon\n",
    " into biomass per year. That plants receive some energy from light– in addition to air, soil, and water– was first discovered in 1779 by Jan Ingenhousz.\"\"\""
